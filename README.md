# UFOs
Working with javascript and html

# Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to create a web page that displays a table of UFO sightings collected and allows end-users the ability to filter the table data based on the search criteria of date, city, state, country, and shape. For this exercise, we are using a variety of front-end development tools to create an appealing webiste. 
### Tools used for this challenege
* Javascript is used to import the data from the data.js file and the script is embedded into the html
* d3 is a javascript library used to look through the html code tags
* Html is used to create a functional webpage that is user-friendly
* Bootstrap is a website styling framework that is used for developing responsive websites
* Css is used to define the styles for our UFO webpage

# Results
To use this UFO sightings website, a user will first visit the url link
https://julianneitliong.github.io/UFOs/

They can scroll down to the filter section and choose their filter criteria

# Summary
Some of the benefits of having a resource such as this website is that those who are interested in researching this topic of UFO sightings, they can use the site to query results of the UFO sightings table. 

One drawback of this website's design is that the user does not know how limited the dataset is. There is no way of knowing what date range this dataset holds (how far back you can research), what states or countries the user can look up, or what the search criteria "shape" means.

Two recommendations for further development for this web app would be to create drop-down menus for the search criteria to display possible results for the filtered table. For example, in the date range, a drop-down list can be used to show how far back the data goes or what the options can be for the "shape" criteria. Another helpful recommendation may to include links to further research or the news resource to the search results to help with the site's credibility.
